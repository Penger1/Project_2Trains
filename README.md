# This is a website where you can put the train station you want to start from and where you want to end up at, and it will tell you what time the train will leave from your selected starting station, it also has a clock with your local time so it will be easy to see how much time you have left.
#I would give myself 20 points for this assignment as it at least in my opinion meets the given requirements and I can see myself using this in the future as I found it quite useful.
